A Fork of Fabulously Optimized, But with additional mods that I personally find useful

# Legal Stuff
## Since this is a fork of Fabulously Optimized, this legal text must be included:

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
## In addition you should note the following:
By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

- The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own.
- The command /ghost (provided by AntiGhost) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers as it sends a slight amount of packets, but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
- This modpack is using Starlight for chunk optimization and due to the way it works, disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
- This modpack disables the third-party server disclaimer, so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following:
> Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone.

    The "social interactions" screen can be used by pressing the key P in-game or the Player Reporting button in the pause menu, where players can ignore others' chat messages or block them with the Microsoft account entirely. However, chat reporting itself is discouraged due to player security and privacy concerns (see the Chat Reporting FAQ).

    Tremendously Optimized does not host any capes or other cosmetics, nor does it encourage users to buy them from any provider. Instead, the modpack encourages users to prefer free cosmetics, while also giving them options to use any paid cosmetics they've previously obtained from certain providers.
